A simple page to solve Fallout hacking puzzles.

To see this project in action, visit the [Fallout Hacker](https://hebarusan.github.io/fallout-hacker) site.

I recommend installing [atom-elastic-tabstops](https://github.com/hax/atom-elastic-tabstops) to read this code, since I indent and align with tabs.
The code should be self-explanatory except for that.
All logic is client-side.
