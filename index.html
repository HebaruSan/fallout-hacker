However, unlike real password guessing, the user is given multiple-choice options and feedback guiding him to the answer. When you guess the wrong word, the game tells you how many of its letters are correct. This number counts only the right letter in the right place, so "abc" and "acb" have a likeness of 1, not 3.</p><p>There is an optimal strategy that can solve any of these puzzles.</p><h2>How does it work?</h2><p>At each step, the word you chose and the likeness number rule out some of the possible answers, and if you keep track after each guess, eventually only one option will remain.</p><p>But you can do slightly better than that. You can choose your guesses in an order that maximizes the speed with which answers are eliminated. This means to pick the word that splits the other words into as many likeness groups as possible, with each group as small as possible.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/HebaruSan/fallout-hacker">Source code &rarr;</a></p></div></div></div></body></html>
